 <pre>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

    Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
    recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
    medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,
    diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get 
    sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission
    is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection 
    by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an 
    alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</pre><br><br><br>
